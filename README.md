# MC NBT Stream
This is a fabric mod for minecraft 1.21.10 which streams NBT entity date for mobs 
in a set radius around the player over a websocket to be consumed by other applications.

This project uses the [Fabric API](https://fabricmc.net/) with Yarn bidnings.

## Purpose
This was created for a project I am working in Max msp to use minecaft entity data for
a generative music piece.

More info on Max msp [here](https://cycling74.com/downloads).

## Developer commands
- `./gradlew build` — compile and package the mod.
- `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` — review dependencies for newer stable releases.
